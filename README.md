![13c5a16a-c509-4554-ac86-293bc0eb441c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3618647/129074558-65de7de2-a0df-4a7f-bc00-97b806409f70.png)

This environment supports qualitative analysis of text (and potentially other media) with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It is an example of an [Integrated Thinking Environment](https://fulcra.design/Posts/Obsidian-Roam-and-the-rise-of-Integrated-Thinking-Environments/).
